            <p>Hayley's passion for design has been from childhood. She would be often found creating. Her passion for coding
                has developed to marry her passion of design and her love of digital art</p>

            <p>When not online, Hayley can be found in Mississauga, Ontario with her husband, Alex â€” searching for the next
                show to binge on Netflix, trying out a new recipe in the kitchen, experimenting in gardening, or snuggling
                with their cats.</p>
